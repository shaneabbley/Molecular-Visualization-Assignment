# Molecular-Visualization-Assignment
This is a small molecular visualization project I completed a little while back.
The first section consists of a visualization created in PyMol and a brief description of the interaction between Oct-4 and the DNA sequence that is the substrate
The second section shows the mechanism and active site, in green, of the chymotrypsin enzyme in PyMol.
The third section highlights the active site and the mechanism of tRNA synthase.
The fourth and final section is a piece of creative writing about a previous PDB molecule of the month; collagen.

The main purpose of this project/repository is to practice the molecular visualization program PyMol and to have fun learning about new proteins. I found the program very easy to pick up and learn. The biggest challenges are using the app with a trackpad and finding the best angle to export a png of the model. It seemed as though prioritizing any specific aspect of the molecule sacrificed clarity for another similarly important part of the molecule. It would be very cool if these visualizations could be placed in a pdf while still being interactive.

I also included a fun little movie of an immunoglobulin visualization I created using PyMol.
