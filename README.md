# Molecular-Visualization-Assignment
This is a small molecular visualization project I completed a little while back.
The first section consists of a visualization created in PyMol and a brief description of the interaction between Oct-4 and the DNA sequence
The second section shows the mechanism and active site, in green, of the chymotrypsin enzyme in PyMol.
The third section highlights the active site and the mechanism of tRNA synthase.
The fourth and final section is a piece of creative writing about a previous PDB molecule of the month; collagen.
